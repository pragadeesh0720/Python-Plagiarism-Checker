-----pip install scikit-learn

os: This is a standard library module in Python that provides a way to interact with the operating system. In this code, it is used to list files in the current directory (os.listdir()).

sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer: This module is part of the scikit-learn library and is used for converting a collection of raw documents to a matrix of TF-IDF features. TF-IDF stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency.

sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity: This module is also part of the scikit-learn library and is used to compute the cosine similarity between samples. In this code, it is used to calculate the similarity between text vectors.

Note: Make sure you have scikit-learn installed. You can install it using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install scikit-learn
Additionally, the code uses the built-in open() function to read the contents of text files.

Make sure that you have these dependencies installed in your Python environment before running the code. If you don't have scikit-learn installed, you can install it using the provided command.
